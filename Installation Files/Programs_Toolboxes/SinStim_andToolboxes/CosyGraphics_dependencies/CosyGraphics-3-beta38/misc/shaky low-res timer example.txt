Seems that your system vendor applied some proper fixes for timing on your system... - Good! ;-)


PTB-INFO: Multi-display setup in explicit multi-display mode detected. Using the following mapping:
PTB-INFO: Screen 0 corresponds to the full Windows desktop area. Useful for stereo presentations in stereomode=4 ...
PTB-INFO: Screen 1 corresponds to the display area of the monitor with the Windows-internal name \\.\DISPLAY1 ...
PTB-INFO: Screen 2 corresponds to the display area of the monitor with the Windows-internal name \\.\DISPLAY2 ...

PTB-INFO: Please note that beamposition queries for accurate Screen('Flip') timestamping are disabled by
PTB-INFO: default on MS-Windows multi-display setups. If you want to use them, first run the 'PerceptualVBLSyncTest'
PTB-INFO: script to verify they're working correctly on your setup. Then you can add the command:
PTB-INFO: Screen('Preference', 'VBLTimestampingMode', 1); at the top of your script to manually enable them.
PTB-INFO: Usually beamposition queries work correctly if both of your displays are set to the same resolution,
PTB-INFO: color depths and video refresh rate, but you *must verify this*.

The first block of tests tests timing precision with the new timing fixes applied...

Testing precision and tick rate of the low precision reference timer and high precision timer...
The average duration of a low-res timer tick is 1.000000 milliseconds.
The low-res timer runs at 1 msec resolution. It is suitable as a fallback-timesource in case
of trouble with the high-res timer. Good!

The low-res timer showed timing spikes a total of 2 times. Maximum spike 3.000000 msecs.

The low-res timer seems to be a bit shaky. That will only be a problem if it shows large spikes often,
because it could cause the online correctness tests to fail (false positive) and trigger an unwanted
switch from the high-res timer to the unreliable low-res timer.
Small occasional spikes are not uncommon on such a deficient system as Windows. Many spikes could
indicate that some of your hardware devices or its drivers don't operate optimally or the system
is severly overloaded in some way.

lag1 =      650.531130 , lag100000 =      650.860956 - Not too important...

Ratio of elapsed time in high-res vs. low-res clock:    1.0004255812

Going to sleep for 10 seconds, then checking if this idle time did something bad...
Elapsed time should be 10 seconds: lowres timer says 10.009000 secs, highres timer says 10.010074 secs.
So far your system behaved well. This could mean it is well behaved.
it could also mean that it is broken, but PTB's built in work-arounds provide
an effective fix for the brokeness.
Unfortunately it could also mean that the test is unable to detect real problems (false negative) :(



The second block of tests tries to assess how your system would behave without
PTB's special builtin work-arounds enabled. This is a hint on how the system behaved
with Psychtoolbox versions prior to 23rd November 2007, and how it would likely behave
with other psychophysics toolkits...

The average duration of a low-res timer tick is 1.000000 milliseconds.
The low-res timer still runs at 1 msec resolution. That means that our test is
not diagnostic. Please exit and restart Matlab, then retry. Make sure that any
kind of multi-media applications are closed while the test is running
